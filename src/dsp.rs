//! This is a pretty funky idea. What if we used a music Digital Signal
//! Processor (DSP) as a creature's brain? It does a lot of what we want. There
//! are input signals; they're transformed and they're output somewhere. It also
//! is performant since it expects to be sampled 44,100 times a second.
//!
//! We could use a slow DSP to control a creature. And we could speed up the DSP
//! if we wanted to "listen" to its brain. Yeah, weird idea, I know.
